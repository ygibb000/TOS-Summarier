1. **Parties & Scope**

   * “Discord” means Discord Inc. and its related companies. ([Discord][1])
   * “Services” means all Discord apps, websites, servers, etc. ([Discord][2])
   * By using Discord, you agree to these terms as well as their other policies (Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, etc.). ([Discord][1])

2. **Age Requirement**

   * You must be at least **13 years old**, or older depending on where you live. ([Discord][2])
   * If you’re a minor, your parent or legal guardian may need to agree to or supervise your account. ([Discord][2])

3. **What Discord Provides**

   * Discord is a platform for communication (text, voice, video) across “servers” (chat rooms) and direct messaging. ([Discord][2])
   * Discord may change, remove, or add features over time. ([Discord][2])
   * They try to maintain safety tools (like for teens / guardians) and accessibility. ([Discord][1])

4. **Accounts**

   * You need an account to use many features: provide email or phone, set a password, and give your birthday. ([Discord][2])
   * You are responsible for keeping your account secure; they recommend using a strong password + two-factor authentication (2FA). ([Discord][2])
   * You should keep your account info (email, phone) up to date so Discord can reach you. ([Discord][2])
   * You’re not allowed to sell, lend, or transfer your account (or Discord username) without permission from Discord. ([Discord][2])

5. **Your Content**

   * “Your content” = anything you post/upload (text, images, video, etc.). ([Discord][2])
   * You must make sure you have the rights to anything you share (copyright, permission, etc.). ([Discord][2])
   * Even though it's yours, by using Discord, you grant them a license to use it (worldwide, royalty-free) — but only for limited purposes: running and improving their service. ([Discord][2])
   * Discord can remove your content if they think it violates their terms, guidelines, or applicable law. ([Discord][1])
   * They may also disclose your content to third parties if required by law or to protect rights/halt harm. ([Discord][2])

6. **Discord’s Content & IP**

   * Discord owns the design, art, and software of its platform. ([Discord][2])
   * You can’t copy, reverse-engineer, or pirate their software. ([Discord][2])
   * Some parts of their software are open-source; those parts are subject to different license terms. ([Discord][2])

7. **Third-Party Content**

   * Discord may link or provide access to external services, websites, and apps. ([Discord][2])
   * But those are controlled by third parties, so Discord isn’t responsible for their content or functionality. ([Discord][1])
   * If you use them, you should read their terms too. ([Discord][2])

8. **Paid Services**

   * Basic Discord use is free. ([Discord][1])
   * There are paid features (Nitro, other purchases); separate terms apply to those. ([Discord][3])

9. **Rules / Restrictions**

   * You must follow all applicable laws, Discord’s TOS, Community Guidelines, and other policies. ([Discord][4])
   * You are prohibited from:

     * Abusing or harassing others, hacking, or gaining unauthorized access. ([Discord][3])
     * Bullying, spamming, or sending mass unsolicited messages. ([Discord][4])
     * Transmitting viruses, using bots in ways they don’t allow, reverse engineering their software, etc. ([Discord][2])

10. **Termination**

    * You can delete your account any time. ([Discord][1])
    * Discord can suspend or terminate your account if you violate the terms. ([Discord][2])
    * Some parts of the agreement survive termination (like the license you granted for your content). ([Discord][2])

11. **Disclaimers / Warranties**

    * Discord provides services **“as is”**, without guarantees. ([Discord][1])
    * They disclaim implied warranties (like “fitness for a particular purpose”), to the fullest extent allowed by law. ([Discord][2])

12. **Liability Limits**

    * Discord limits their liability heavily: for example, they’re not liable for lost profits, lost data, or service interruptions (within the bounds of law). ([Discord][1])
    * If a claim arises, their maximum liability is either: what you paid in the last 3 months **or** $100 USD (or equivalent), whichever is greater. ([Discord][1])
    * They also say they’re not responsible for what other users do on the platform. ([Discord][1])

13. **Dispute Resolution**

    * **Arbitration Clause**: For U.S. and Canada users, there’s an arbitration clause + a waiver of class-action lawsuits. ([Discord][1])
    * This means in many cases you can’t sue Discord in court — disputes will be handled via arbitration, unless you opt out (depending on terms). ([Discord][1])

14. **Other Legal Stuff**

    * They may update the TOS. If changes are “material,” they’ll give advance notice (unless urgent). ([Discord][1])
    * By continuing to use the service after changes, you accept them. ([Discord][1])
    * You agree to comply with export control laws (e.g. not using Discord to distribute content that breaks export restrictions). ([Discord][2])
    * There are standard legal clauses about severability, waiver, and assignment. ([Discord][1])
