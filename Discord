  <h2>1. Parties &amp; Scope</h2>

    <li>Discord is a platform for communication (text, voice, video) across “servers” (chat rooms) and direct messaging.</li>
    <li>Discord may change, remove, or add features over time.</li>
    <li>They try to maintain safety tools (like for teens / guardians) and accessibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Accounts</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>You are responsible for keeping your account secure; they recommend using a strong password + two-factor authentication (2FA).</li>
    <li>You should keep your account info (email, phone) up to date so Discord can reach you.</li>

    <li>“Your content” = anything you post/upload (text, images, video, etc.).</li>
    <li>You must make sure you have the rights to anything you share (copyright, permission, etc.).</li>
    <li>Even though it's yours, by using Discord, you grant them a license to use it (worldwide, royalty-free) — but only for limited purposes: running and improving their service.</li>
    <li>Discord can remove your content if they think it violates their terms, guidelines, or applicable law.</li>
    <li>They may also disclose your content to third parties if required by law or to protect rights/halt harm.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discord may link or provide access to external services, websites, and apps.</li>
    <li>But those are controlled by third parties, so Discord isn’t responsible for their content or functionality.</li>
